        <div class="card p-4 mb-3 des">
            This total contant.In recent years, Australian bushfires have attracted widespread attention in the international community. The large-scale bushfires that continue every year have caused severe economic losses, human and animal casualties, and significant damage to the ecosystem. This website uses publicly available online data combined with Vega-Lite to conduct a visual analysis of the 2019 Australian bushfires. The main analysis focuses on three aspects: the geographical locations of the bushfires, the situation of bushfires in each state, and the monthly situation of bushfires in 2019, including the relationship between the number of bushfires and the area affected, as well as the casualties of animals caused by the bushfires.
            <br>
            <br>
            Through the visualization on this website, you can interact with it to gain a basic understanding of the 2019 Australian bushfires.

                    <hr>
                    By visualizing the locations and intensity of wildfires on the map, while providing multiple dropdowns for interactive data exploration, we can roughly draw a conclusion: in Western Australia, wildfires are distributed both inland and along the coast, whereas in the East, they are mainly along the coast. For detailed ranges, you can use the visualization and mouse to explore further.

                    <hr>
                    The number of wildfires in each state is distinguished through a color block heat map to compare the differences in wildfire occurrences between states. Additionally, it's quite interesting that you can view the monthly wildfire trend line chart for 2019 in each state by moving the mouse over the state map.

                    <hr>
                    From the observed graph, it can be seen that in January, October, November, and December, both the number and intensity of wildfires are relatively significant. Furthermore, from October to December, wildfires increase rapidly month by month, indicating that these are prone months for wildfires and require special attention.

                    <hr>
                    By observing the bubble chart, it can be seen that the number of wildfires is linearly positively correlated with the area affected by the wildfires. At the same time, you can explore the number of wildfires and the area affected by wildfires in different states and months by clicking on the legend.

                    <hr>
                    Australia’s bushfire crisis was one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history. The fires killed or displaced nearly 3 billion animals.
                    Uprooting families and claiming lives, bushfires raged across Australia from June 2019 to February 2020. New WWF research reveals that the toll on wildlife was around three times higher than an earlier study estimated.
                    In total, 143 million mammals, 2.46 billion reptiles, 180 million birds, and 51 million frogs were harmed. “It’s a difficult number to comprehend,” said Professor Chris Dickman of the University of Sydney.
